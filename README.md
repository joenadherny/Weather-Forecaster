# Weather-Forecaster
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

I struggled for a good bit trying to figure out how to use the js to mkae sure all the functions were correct. I used resources across stack overflow along with youtube to be able to understand hwo to mkae the api work in my favor. I struggled with the styling aspect and prioritzed getting a working js along with a managleable html. I understand it is not the prettiest of pages but proud I was able to at least meet most of the requirements.
